# First Basic SQL Project
This was the first SQL code I wrote after taking courses online and watching lots youtube videos.
I decided it was time to try something even though basic.
It is very beginner friendly and you should actually try it out if you are just starting out with SQL.
Check out the excel file containing the dataset I used, there is also the SQL file containing the basic queries and a PDF file that shows the visualization.
I used PowerBI for the visualization by the way.
